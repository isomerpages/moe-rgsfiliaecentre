## Shell Nxplorers 2021

Participating in Shell NXplorers 2021 was very enriching for us. It was a platform for us to explore our interest in STEM, whilst also helping us to be more aware of issues related to sustainability in Singapore. It was an outlet for our creativity, where we were able to develop our skills in research and problem-solving. Through the process, we learnt many skill sets such as the NXtools which empowered us to become positive agents of change in our VUCA world. 

Our project aimed to make air conditioners in Singapore more energy-efficient, while producing useful products such as potable water - focusing on the Food – Water – Energy Nexus. Through rigorous research and evaluation, we were able to come up with a retrofitted model of the current aircon, and even found out a suitable new refrigerant that is much more sustainable. We are grateful that our team was shortlisted as one of the 10 finalist teams out of the 127 team registrations from 52 schools. Alongside with us were 3 other RGS teams which were also shortlisted as finalist teams

After 7 months of intense preparation and meetings, the day of the NXplorers Finals arrived! The Finals was graced by the Science Centre Singapore’s Chief Executive, Assoc Prof Lim Tit Meng as well as Shell’s Head of Corporate Relations Southeast Asia, Mr Sahala Sianipar. Although the event was held over Zoom, we could feel the spirit of innovation through our screens. We gave a 10-minute presentation on our solution, followed by a 5-minute Q&A session with the judges, namely Mr Loh Seng Yee (VP Sales Asia Pacific, Shell Catalyst and Technologies Pte Ltd), Mr Danny Chua (Managing Director, CYC Pte Ltd) and Mr Vincent Lau (Chief Technology Officer, Pylon City). Eventually, we were awarded the 1st Runners-Up!

However, what truly stood out to us during this journey was the camaraderie and Rafflesian spirit that all the teams showed. The support and encouragement from everyone was much more valuable than any award that we could take away from this journey.

We are extremely grateful to have been able to work with such wonderful mentors, both from Shell (special thanks to our mentor, Mr Ng Shao Shen!) and our teacher mentors (Mdm Cindy Tiong and Ms Chia Wei Ling), as well as the other teams (Teams ERA, Blue Aqua and Breakthrough) who were also participating in the competition alongside us!
