"The Singapore Young Physicists' Tournament (SYPT), inspired by the International Young Physicists' Tournament, tests participants' ability to solve complicated real-world physics problems through Physics Fights. In a typical Fight, the Reporter presents her solutions to proposed problems in a convincing way, defending their stand through scientific discussions with the Opponent.  
  
<u>Physics</u><br>
As its name suggests, the competition's preparation process simulates the work of physicists: research, modelling, experimentation and finally, an oral defence before peers and experts. The three of us explored our areas of interests: Isabelle learnt about fluid dynamics, Sangeun delved deeper into Darcy's Law and Qianshu learnt to use Arduino to build a LDR detector. Through this enriching experience, we were enthralled by physics.  
  
<u>Teamwork</u><br>
From team selections in October to the competition in March, we worked together tirelessly towards the completion of our problems. SYPT is not about one single problem or one single member, but rather, the collaboration that enables progress. Through the long months and hours in the Physics labs and the school hall, we built a strong sense of camaraderie that pulled us through numerous complications.  
  
<u>Perseverance</u><br>
Yes, you heard right. SYPT was hard. Along the way, we faced challenges from experimental difficulties to tight budgets, but we persevered through it all. We devised solutions, which made us better thinkers. SYPT also required much dedication, which meant full-day lab sessions during holidays and entire afternoons in the lab during term time. This caused a tremendous amount of stress, but we learnt how to better manage our time. Overall, the challenge of the competition developed our growth mindset, and taught us to be positive despite the challenges."
