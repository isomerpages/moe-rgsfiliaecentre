## Raffles Academy Coursework Module Reflections

Raffles Academy (RA) was created to help every RGS student experience the joy of learning by discovering her interests, growing her passion and mastering skills and knowledge in a chosen area of talent. It is a talent development platform for all Year 3 and 4 students.  
  
In RA, students can choose to take up either one Coursework Module (CM) or one Research Module (RM) in Year 3. CMs comprise classroom lessons and may include field trips, field studies and experiments. Students are expected to be self-directed, be willing to commit the time to read up and participate readily during class discussions.  
  
Read about our students' personal reflections for their chosen CMs at the respective links below:
