## Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Award

Taking part in the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Award (TKKYIA) and being awarded the “Encouragement Award” for my invention, “Computer Vision (Object Tracking) Robotic Car for ADHD Children”, was an enriching experience for me in my invention journey.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the organisers had combined the 2020/2021 submissions and held the judging event virtually on 7 Aug 2021 for shortlisted participants. I had the opportunity to share with the judges my design-thinking process for the robotic car that I created as an interactive playmate/companion for my little cousin to help manage his ADHD symptoms. In turn, I benefited a lot from the judges’ invaluable feedback and suggestions on how to further enhance the capabilities of my invention.  
  
Thomas Edison once said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work”. Inventing is a learning process filled with challenges, so do not be discouraged by them and persevere!
