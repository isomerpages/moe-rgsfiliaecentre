The objectives of student well-being and support are:

*   To conduct educational and career guidance programmes and counselling
*   To offer life-coaching opportunities to students who desire to maximise their potentials in their personal lives
*   To train students, teachers and parents in life-coaching to become peer-coaches, teacher-coaches and parent-coaches
*   To empower students to grow in holistic ways through the Thrive Sessions
*   To support students with special needs in their educational pursuits and social-emotional development
*   To extend selected programmes to neighbouring schools to facilitate social mixing of students
