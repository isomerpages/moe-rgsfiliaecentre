## Character & Leadership Education

<img src="/images/cnle.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>

Character & Leadership Education (CLE) is an integral part of the RGS mission to nurture our students to be leaders who will realise her talents in service of nation and community. The school takes a holistic approach to CLE, seeking to integrate the cognitive, with the affective and social aspects of education.  
  
In line with that, the KNOW, DO, BE principle is adopted so that our students are provided with the necessary knowledge and understanding (KNOW) of what constitutes good character and leadership, given the opportunities to practise the attendant skills (DO) and develop competencies and attitudes (BE) of a person who is:

*   A good steward of her life
*   An active and socially responsible citizen
*   A reflective and visionary leader

CLE forms the basis of the Raffles Programme, as it is attended to at four levels:

*   Infusion and integration in every subject
*   School-wide structures, policies and practices
*   Co-curricular programmes
*   CLE curriculum
