					<td><img src="/images/td1.jpg" style="width:85%"><br><br>Like gems, potential or natural abilities need to be appropriately nurtured and developed before an individual can realise and achieve her potential with excellence. The goal of talent development in RGS is to help our students understand their own interests, strengths and potential, to know how to pursue and engage in the best talent development activities and for them to commit themselves to the development of their talents, so that they may become women of scholarship who will be the leaders of distinction committed to excellence and enterprise, in service of the nation and the community.<br><br>Our talent development programme follows Dr Treffinger’s Levels of Service (LoS) approach. Based on more than two decades of research, the four levels of services serve as a guiding framework for designing appropriate and challenging learning experiences. They range from a broad array of services for the school-wide population (Level 1) to those focused more specifically on the characteristics and readiness of students in specific talent areas that are demonstrated by a few (Level 4).</td>
