The goal of talent development in RGS is to help our students understand their own interests, strengths and potential, to know how to pursue and engage in the best talent development activities and for them to commit themselves to the development of their talents, so that they may become women of scholarship who will be the leaders of distinction committed to excellence and enterprise, in service of the nation and the community.<br><br>Our talent development programme follows Dr Treffinger’s Levels of Service (LoS) approach. Based on more than two decades of research, the four levels of services serve as a guiding framework for designing appropriate and challenging learning experiences. They range from a broad array of services for the school-wide population (Level 1) to those focused more specifically on the characteristics and readiness of students in specific talent areas that are demonstrated by a few (Level 4).</td>

In this way, a platform is provided for our students to integrate and apply their knowledge from the classroom to real world issues. They are able to engage in research projects in a range of areas, including Science, Mathematics, Engineering, IT, Business, Humanities, Creative Writing and the Fine Arts. As projects are typically of a high intellectual standard, many of our students go on to showcase their work at various local and international programmes and competitions, including the Singapore Science & Engineering Fair, Odyssey of the Mind and Future Problem Solving Program.</td>
