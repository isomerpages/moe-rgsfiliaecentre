## Service Learning

<img src="/images/Service Learning.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>

The RGS Service-Learning programme seeks to nurture our students to be socially responsible individuals through the provision of opportunities to perform meaningful community service. It is carried out across their four years in RGS and is embedded in the Character and Leadership Education programme. Through service learning, our students actively engage in enhancing the well-being of the local community and grow to become independent, pro-active learners. They are equipped and empowered to serve, explore and act on real community needs. This includes the Overseas Service-Learning programme for selected students and civic engagement projects through the Community Problem Solving programme.

Based on \*Treffingerâ€™s Levels of Service (LoS), service learning in RGS is designed to provide for the different profiles of our students, who will complete a Community Exploration project by the time they are in Year 2. With this foundation, our students can make informed choices and pursue Community Action projects or continue with Community Service/Exploration projects when they are in Year 3 and Year 4.
