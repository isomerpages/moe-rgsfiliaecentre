## Service Learning

<img src="/images/Service Learning.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>

The RGS Service-Learning programme seeks to nurture our students to be socially responsible individuals through the provision of opportunities to perform meaningful community service. It is carried out across their four years in RGS and is embedded in the Character and Leadership Education programme. Through service learning, our students actively engage in enhancing the well-being of the local community and grow to become independent, pro-active learners. They are equipped and empowered to serve, explore and act on real community needs. This includes the Overseas Service-Learning programme for selected students and civic engagement projects through the Community Problem Solving programme.

Based on \*Treffinger’s Levels of Service (LoS), service learning in RGS is designed to provide for the different profiles of our students, who will complete a Community Exploration project by the time they are in Year 2. With this foundation, our students can make informed choices and pursue Community Action projects or continue with Community Service/Exploration projects when they are in Year 3 and Year 4.

          <td>The Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme is a differentiated programme for students with a strong passion for service and who want to understand key issues in the community, and use problem solving skills to solve real-world problems. Working in teams of about six to eight members, our students identify an area of concern in a community, explore challenges, establish an underlying problem, propose an action plan to solve the problem, then carry out their proposed solution and reflect on learning and impact on the community.<br>
          <br>
          Some examples of CmPS projects include working with NParks to resolve the problem of public feeding of animals in the nature reserve, releasing of animals into the environment and improving the quality of living for the elderly.</td>

          <td>RGS’ very first Overseas Service-Learning trip took place in Kerala, India, in 2004, where a group of 30 students and four teachers taught basic Information Technology (IT) skills to students at a high school and conducted a reading programme for children in an orphanage, which they also refurbished. Subsequently, more trips were planned to other parts of Asia, such as Kumbalum (India) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) from 2005 onwards after reviewing the benefits of the programme for developing the character and leadership of our students, besides the impact of meeting the needs of the communities they served.<br>
          <br>
          The objectives of the programme are: <br>* To serve the needs of beneficiary communities overseas in a way that promotes self-sustainability and positive reciprocity <br>* To develop character, leadership and other life skills of our students as they aspire to meaningfully contribute to improving the lives of underprivileged youths and their communities<br><br>
          Since 2004, the programme has developed and initiated projects in Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines together with the assistance of NGOs in those countries. Students work with NGOs of identified communities over a sustained three to five years. with the motto ‘A Legacy of Love’, past and present members of the programme have impacted over 2,000 people in needy communities.</td>
